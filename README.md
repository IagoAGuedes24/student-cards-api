# Student Cards API
Student Cards is a Spring Boot Back-end API that aims to facilitate the contact between students, professors and assistants by using a cards-related logic, where students can use them to clarify doubts about specific topics in the discipline by professors and assistants answers. It was developed as a vacation project by [Vin√≠cius Azevedo](https://github.com/viniciussousaazevedo) and [Iago Albuquerque](https://github.com/IagoAGuedes24) in January 2023.

## User Stories and planning aspects
If you want to see User stories and planning aspects (portuguese only), check out by clicking [here](). As we used Trello for the project management, we can only give "view only" access if we pay for and upgrade. Knowing that, we ask for you to only view the process, and not edit anything that is already there.
